tell me for this SAAS do i have competiters

Yes — your NeuroCanvas SaaS idea sits at the intersection of AI productivity, mind mapping, and collaborative thinking tools — and you do have competitors, but none of them combine all the elements you're proposing in the same way (voice input → AI processing → mind map → realtime collaboration + emotional coaching).

Here's a breakdown of your competitive landscape by category:

🧠 Mind Mapping Tools (Non-AI or Minimal AI)
1. MindMeister
🟢 Visual, collaborative mind mapping

🔴 No voice input, limited AI

🔴 Traditional UX, not node-based like n8n

2. XMind
🟢 Very popular, multiple map layouts

🔴 Mostly offline or desktop-focused

🔴 No GPT-4 or real AI coaching

3. Coggle
🟢 Beautiful mind map editor, realtime collab

🔴 No AI or voice input

🔴 Lacks coaching/thought extraction

🤖 AI Writing / Thought Assistants
4. Notion AI
🟢 Strong AI writing & organization

🔴 No native visual mind mapping

🔴 No drag-and-drop flow builder

5. Reflect.app
🟢 GPT-powered personal knowledge graph

🔴 Very text-based, not visual

🔴 Closed, private-first (not collab-focused)

6. Mem.ai
🟢 AI-generated connections and note linking

🔴 Linear timeline UX, not spatial maps

🔴 No visual flow builder or node-based UI

🧠🤖 AI Mind Mapping Tools (Closest Competitors)
7. Whimsical AI
🟢 Can generate flowcharts and mind maps with AI

🔴 AI feels like an add-on, not core

🔴 Limited real-time collaboration tools

🔴 Lacks voice input and thought coaching

8. Mindgrasp.ai
🟢 AI summarizes and organizes knowledge visually

🔴 More study-focused (summarizing PDFs)

🔴 Not true creative thought mapping from scratch

9. Tana
🟢 Hybrid between Notion, Roam, and AI

🔴 Knowledge graph, not flow/mind-map UI

🔴 Steeper learning curve
