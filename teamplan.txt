Absolutely — this concept is incredibly powerful for teams and could become a category-defining product.

You're describing something like a “Real-Time Collaborative Cognitive Canvas” — where spoken ideas are automatically captured, visualized, and connected into a dynamic mind map by AI.

Let’s break down how to make this work, feature by feature, so you can build it into your SaaS and blow the ceiling off team ideation tools.

🧠 ✨ Your Core Vision:
“When a team enters a room, a blank canvas appears. They start talking. The AI listens, captures every person’s thoughts, and turns them into a connected mind map — live, visual, and interactive.”

✅ Key System Behaviors You Need
Feature	Description
🎙️ Voice-driven input	Team members speak — system transcribes in real time.
👥 Speaker identification	Track who said what using speaker labels or login context.
🧠 Real-time AI mapping	AI processes each sentence → breaks it into a node or connects it.
🔄 Connection intelligence	GPT finds thematic links, contradictions, or dependencies.
🌐 Collaborative canvas	All users see the map update live and can move/edit nodes.
🗂️ Auto-categorization	AI clusters related ideas: goals, blockers, questions, etc.
🧩 Team templates	Rooms can be created from a meeting type template (brainstorm, retro, etc.)
🔁 Map playback	Replay the conversation flow like a “thought timeline.”
📤 Export as actionables	Convert key points into tasks for Notion, Jira, etc.

 12.4 Speaker Thought Attribution

Attach username or color to each node

Optional: voice fingerprinting or login context to match speakers

 12.5 Smart Connection Engine

AI creates edges between ideas with similar meaning

Example: connects “Let’s build a plugin system” with “We’ll need a flexible API”

 12.6 Live React Flow Canvas Updates

Nodes appear in real-time

Auto-layout algorithm (radial, force, or layered tree)

 12.7 Thought Clustering & Grouping

Auto-group ideas into categories like:

🧱 Ideas

⚠️ Problems

✅ Actions

❓Questions

 12.8 Team Cursors & Editing

Everyone can see where others are

Drag, link, or delete nodes collaboratively

 12.9 Save + Session Playback

Store map state as a timeline

Replay it like a conversation history

 12.10 One-Click Export

Send map highlights to:

Notion

Jira/Trello

PDF/JSON

Meeting summary doc
