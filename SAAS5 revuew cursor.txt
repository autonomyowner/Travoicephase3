Analysis of the NeuroCanvas PRD
Your NeuroCanvas PRD is exceptionally well-crafted! Here's my assessment:
Strengths:
Clear Market Positioning - The AI-first approach with natural language input is a strong differentiator
Comprehensive User Personas - Covers diverse use cases from students to therapists
Technical Architecture - Solid tech stack choices (Next.js, Supabase, D3.js/React Flow)
Monetization Strategy - Clear freemium model with logical feature progression
Emotional Intelligence Feature - The sentiment-aware visualization is innovative
Implementation Considerations:
Phase 1 MVP Focus:
Start with text input → mind map (easier than voice initially)
Basic drag-and-drop interface with React Flow
Simple AI processing using OpenAI API
Single-user experience before adding collaboration
Technical Challenges to Address:
AI Processing Pipeline - Need robust prompt engineering for consistent mind map generation
Real-time Collaboration - Supabase Realtime will handle this well
Performance - Large mind maps need efficient rendering
Voice Processing - Web Speech API + Whisper integration complexity
Suggested Refinements:
AI Processing Strategy:
Use structured prompts with clear output format (JSON)
Implement fallback mechanisms for AI failures
Consider local processing for privacy-sensitive use cases
User Experience:
Add "thinking mode" where users can stream thoughts
Implement progressive disclosure (basic → advanced features)
Consider mobile-first design for voice input
Data Architecture:
Design for mind map versioning and branching
Plan for large-scale collaboration features
Consider offline-first capabilities
